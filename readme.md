## üì¢ &nbsp; Milestone Check-Ins

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going.  
Use the prompts below as a guide on what to write about.    
For each Milestone #2-4, you should use all 4 icons.   

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
üåµ Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Milestone 1

For this milestone you will have created a wireframe prototype in Figma.   
Post your link here, so you have easy access to it.
- Figma Link


<br>

### Milestone 2
‚öôÔ∏è Overview - Write overview here.
This week I worked on getting the whole shell working properly. Including all 4 pages. As well as making sure all of the routing is working well. 
üåµ Challenges - Write challenges here.
One of the challenges I have is that I have the menu in the oppposite colors than I'll need. the reason why os because whenever I enable dark mode I will want it to look how it does now. But the BIGGEST issue I had was being able to connect my project to my Github. It kept going to my personal github and not my school github account. I will not make that mistake again. 
üèÜ Accomplishments - Write Accomplishments here.
The accomplishments I had I would say was figuring out how to connect my github. Also, ensure all my pages were routing properly. 
üîÆ Next Steps - Write your next steps here.
My next steps are to inplement the API. I also would liike the settings page to have all of the buttons functional. 
<br>

Please discuss the following:  
#### Page #1   
- Name - Hone 
- Purpose  - Literally just the home, where you you can decide to start or not. 

#### Page #2   
- Name  - Search
- Purpose - To search up a type of Dog Breed.   

#### Page #3   
- Name - Details 
- Purpose  - Here is where it will display all of the dogs you've searched. They will stay there until you can clear it.  

#### Page #4   
- Name - Settings 
- Purpose - Here you can clear the details page, enable dark mode, contact us (probably via email, havent decided yet), and lastly you can see the terms and conditions.  

#### Remember that creating a project board, issues, and milestones is 50% of your grade!     
If you are having trouble, contact your instructor ASAP, you might need to be part of the ePortoflio group to have better access.

### Milestone 3
‚öôÔ∏è Overview - Write overview here.
<br>
This milestone marks the completion of a working React app. The app has multiple pages, connects to real APIs, saves data using local storage, and uses extra tools to add features. I believe it meets all the requirements and makes for a smooth experience for the  users.
<br>
üåµ Challenges - Write challenges here.
<br>
I encountered multiple issues on finalizing this project. I had an issue where it was passing through the API and wouldn't provide any data on the details. I also encountered an issue where if you hit refresh it would keep making duplicates of the dog image on the settings page. Getting the API on the home page was giving me issues as well, it was passing the data but not displaying. 
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - Write Accomplishments here.
<br>
Succesfully implemented React routing across all pages. I have two fully funtional API's integrated into the project. The local storage I chose is functioning perfectly.
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - Write your next steps here.
<br>
My next steps will just be further testing and any other debugging. As well as make the video and everything for week 4 that needs be done. 
<br>

Please discuss the following:
#### API    
- Link to the API that is used in your code    
https://dog-api.kinduff.com/api/facts
- Reason you chose the API    
I chose it becuase it provides fun dog facts the coinside with my project seamlessly
- Where in your code did you use it?    
I used it on the home page, on the left side. It just radomly will put dog facts in a card I have setup.

#### 1st Library
- Link to the library    
https://reactrouter.com/
- Link to library tutorial that you made already.   
I did not make one. 
- Reason you chose this library.    
I chose it because it allows for easy navigation from page to page throughout the entire project.
- Where in your code is it used?    
Its used across all 4 pages. Home, Search, Details and Settings. 

#### 2nd Library    
- Link to the library    
https://github.com/donavon/use-dark-mode
- Reason you chose this library.   
I thought about the darkmode idea early on in my project. Honestly I didnt know Id be using it as a library until it come to the point of using it.  
- Where in your code is it used?    
Its implemented on the settings page, but once enabled its used across all pages. 

#### Persistent Data    
- Discuss if you have used MongoDB or Local Storage. 
I used Local storage   
- How was it used in your code?    
Its used in two ways. One way is too keep every dog you search on the details page. Also once youi enable dark mode I used local storage to maintin the theme across all pages.
- Where in your code is it used?    
Its used on the details and on all pages once darkmode is enabled.

### Milestone 4
‚öôÔ∏è Overview - Write overview here.
<br>
In Milestone 4, I worked on making the app look better by using Bootstrap for styling. I also focused on fixing issues with dark mode and making sure the design worked well on different screen sizes. The goal was to make the app look consistent and easy to use.
<br>
üåµ Challenges - Write challenges here.
<br>
I had a hard time with dark mode because it changed the whole page instead of just the buttons and input fields. Adding Bootstrap was confusing since it messed up my styles sometimes. The navigation bar and other things on the page didn‚Äôt stay in the right spot, which made the layout look wrong. It was also tricky to make all the pages look the same but still a little different. 
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - Write Accomplishments here.
<br>
I used Bootstrap to make the app look nicer and easier to use. I made sure the navigation bar stays at the top, and the content shows up below it. I also fixed the layout so it works well on big and small screens. 
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - Write your next steps here.
There are no next steps it is all done. And the class is now over. 
<br>

Please discuss the following:  
#### Changes
- Discuss any changes or updates that you have made to your site since Milestone #3.
I changed the whole way it is styled using bootstrap. Thats the only changes made. 
#### Styling
- Discuss the process you used to style your page.
Honeslty I only used bootstrap because tailwind was not working. 
#### Link To Overview Video
- Once it is created, put the link to your overview video of your site here.

# Project Overview

### Your project will use the MERN Tech Stack and must include the following:

-   A Git Repo, with a master, dev, and milestone branches
-   Readme File that explains your project and tracks your milestones
-   A React Front End
-   React Routing with  _at least_  4 different views/pages
    -   Dashboard/Main
    -   User/Settings
    -   Search
    -   Detail Page
-   Node/Express Backend
-   A Mongo DB Element OR Local Storage for persistent data
-   Connect to at least 1 free API
-   The project must use at least 2 different libraries, not including React itself
    -   One of these libraries you will create a tutorial for in Exercise 01
-   It should look visually appealing and must be easy for the end-user to use and understand. You may use Tailwind or any other front-end library/framework.

**Milestone #1 (Due: Monday of Week 2)**

-   Decide on your topic and theme for your project.
    -   Check out the Free API sites for some ideas of an API that you can utilize
        -   [Apipheny](https://apipheny.io/free-api/)  
            
        -   [Mixed Analytics](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/)  
            
        -   [I Am Sajan](https://iamsajan.com/free-api-without-an-api-key/)  
            
-   Functional Spec that explains the scope of the work and the deadlines that must be met.  
    
-   Create a Wireframe Prototype in Figma that will help non-tech people understand your idea.
    -   Keep in mind that a lot of your bosses will need only high-level concepts and will not be concerned with the actual code. The code is your job.

**Milestone #2 **(Due: Monday of Week 3)****

-   Create your Git Repo using the provided link, which will clone over a blank repo.
-   Start to code your project.
    -   I will not give you a step-by-step guide for this.
    -   At this point, you must use your skills and build it out yourself.
-   Along the way, if you get stuck, you may reach out to the lab assistants, but remember this is YOUR portfolio project, and troubleshooting your own code is a part of this process.
-   By Milestone #2, I am going to be checking that you have a React app that can compile without error and that you have your navigation up and running.

**Milestone #3 **(Due: Monday of Week 4)****

-   By this point, you should have a functional prototype of your project. It might not look pretty yet, but that is what the final week is for.
-   Your Git Repo should have a number of significant commits pushed to it.

**Milestone #4 **(Due: Sunday of Week 4)****

-   Your completed project will be due.
-   You must create a (3 to 10) minute long video that goes through your project, what you did this month, and the technologies that you used to get it working.
    -   Remember it is your job to sell your work and really show it off.
