## 📢 &nbsp; Milestone Check-Ins

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going.  
Use the prompts below as a guide on what to write about.    
For each Milestone #2-4, you should use all 4 icons.   

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Milestone 1

For this milestone you will have created a wireframe prototype in Figma.   
Post your link here, so you have easy access to it.
- Figma Link

### Milestone 2
⚙️ Overview - Write overview here.
This week I worked on getting the whole shell working properly. Including all 4 pages. As well as making sure all of the routing is working well. 
🌵 Challenges - Write challenges here.
One of the challenges I have is that I have the menu in the oppposite colors than I'll need. the reason why os because whenever I enable dark mode I will want it to look how it does now. But the BIGGEST issue I had was being able to connect my project to my Github. It kept going to my personal github and not my school github account. I will not make that mistake again. 
🏆 Accomplishments - Write Accomplishments here.
The accomplishments I had I would say was figuring out how to connect my github. Also, ensure all my pages were routing properly. 
🔮 Next Steps - Write your next steps here.
My next steps are to inplement the API. I also would liike the settings page to have all of the buttons functional.

# Project Overview

### Your project will use the MERN Tech Stack and must include the following:

-   A Git Repo, with a master, dev, and milestone branches
-   Readme File that explains your project and tracks your milestones
-   A React Front End
-   React Routing with  _at least_  4 different views/pages
    -   Dashboard/Main
    -   User/Settings
    -   Search
    -   Detail Page
-   Node/Express Backend
-   A Mongo DB Element OR Local Storage for persistent data
-   Connect to at least 1 free API
-   The project must use at least 2 different libraries, not including React itself
    -   One of these libraries you will create a tutorial for in Exercise 01
-   It should look visually appealing and must be easy for the end-user to use and understand. You may use Tailwind or any other front-end library/framework.

**Milestone #1 (Due: Monday of Week 2)**

-   Decide on your topic and theme for your project.
    -   Check out the Free API sites for some ideas of an API that you can utilize
        -   [Apipheny](https://apipheny.io/free-api/)  
            
        -   [Mixed Analytics](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/)  
            
        -   [I Am Sajan](https://iamsajan.com/free-api-without-an-api-key/)  
            
-   Functional Spec that explains the scope of the work and the deadlines that must be met.  
    
-   Create a Wireframe Prototype in Figma that will help non-tech people understand your idea.
    -   Keep in mind that a lot of your bosses will need only high-level concepts and will not be concerned with the actual code. The code is your job.

**Milestone #2 **(Due: Monday of Week 3)****

-   Create your Git Repo using the provided link, which will clone over a blank repo.
-   Start to code your project.
    -   I will not give you a step-by-step guide for this.
    -   At this point, you must use your skills and build it out yourself.
-   Along the way, if you get stuck, you may reach out to the lab assistants, but remember this is YOUR portfolio project, and troubleshooting your own code is a part of this process.
-   By Milestone #2, I am going to be checking that you have a React app that can compile without error and that you have your navigation up and running.

**Milestone #3 **(Due: Monday of Week 4)****

-   By this point, you should have a functional prototype of your project. It might not look pretty yet, but that is what the final week is for.
-   Your Git Repo should have a number of significant commits pushed to it.

**Milestone #4 **(Due: Sunday of Week 4)****

-   Your completed project will be due.
-   You must create a (3 to 10) minute long video that goes through your project, what you did this month, and the technologies that you used to get it working.
    -   Remember it is your job to sell your work and really show it off.
